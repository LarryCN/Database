# Database Django 1.7 
Database_project

Here we build an online service, which might be alike music streaming services such as Spotify, to offer information about bands and concerts. In our system, a user can register,create a profile, log in, become fans of bands and follow other users that they are interested in, as well as post information about new bands and upcoming concerts. Certainly, artists/bands can also be able to register, create a profile, log in, post information about their upcoming performances, including time and date, venue (location), and ticket prices and availabilities. In addition, our system has a reputation system and recommendation system. In the reputation system, the users allowed by administrator can post concert information. And in the recommendation system, users can get concert information recommended by their own preference and past ratings they gave concerts.
